1,Ride,"We can make a movie
We can take our time introducing Submarine
Careful while you're cruising
Gonna be a ride, introducing Submarine
We can make a movie
We can take our time introducing Submarine
Careful while you're cruising
Gonna be a ride introducing Submarine
(Introducing Submarine)
Introducing Submarine"
2,Hamptons,"Weekend in the hamptons
All the wives were dressed in white
Leaving without laughing
While i wait for your reply
But it's never gonna come
I'm a little bit in love
Comes a time when silence
Melts away into the tides
Threw my phone in crisis
Wasn't aiming for your eyes
Never gonna come
I'm a little bit in love
I have one more question
Were you ever so sincere
God I learned my lesson
Falling for a man in tears
Cuz he only keeps me up
And he always calls my bluff"
3,Echo,"I wonder what it's like to be alone
If you won't call me back, I guess I'll know
If I start to touch the ground
And can taste it in my mouth
Is my hand touching yours?
If I hold it, I won't let go
Won't let go
This is overdramatic
Headed back from New York
'Cause we both know that this situation's out of control
Now I'm caught in the middle
Breaking down on the floor
'Cause we both know that this situation's out of control
I landed, then I felt myself decay
Was crying out for help, but no one came
It's the act of letting go
When at last, I feel I'm home
Miss the warmth of your neck when I knew you the best
I'm yours, I'm yours
This is overdramatic
Headed back from New York
'Cause we both know that this situation's out of control
Now I'm caught in the middle
Breaking down on the floor
'Cause we both know that this situation's out of control
The moon turned black when I left you
Your T-shirt still on my back
Got lifetimes left to forget you
I should've turned back, but I wasted it all for nothing
For a light that'll never last
Now I stand at your front door, hoping that you'll take me back
This is overdramatic
Headed back from New York
'Cause we both know that this situation's out of control
Now I'm caught in the middle
Breaking down on the floor
'Cause we both know that this situation's out of control
Situation's out of control
Your cry is an echo, and I will let go of your love
Your voice is an echo, and I will let go of your love
Situation's out of control"
4,Run Your Mouth,"When we talk about, everything that happened
Would rather sit around, I don't need a lesson
You'd just call me out, call me when I'm distant
Always run your mouth, I don't wanna listen
You're on my case (mhm)
Won't you stop with that look on your face?
And I can't believe (mhm)
That you only hold me when I'm on my knees
Got me so tied up, when you push my luck
Thought you wanted this to last for life
Got me so fed up, when you talk too much
When your focus is all out of line
When we talk about everything that happened
Rather sit around, don't need another lesson
You'd just call me out, call me when I'm distant
Always run your mouth, I don't wanna listen
When we talk about, everything that happened
Rather sit around, don't need another lesson
You'd just call me out, call me when I'm distant
Always run your mouth, I don't wanna
Everything that happened
Uh-huh, oh, oh
All the shit you put me through, put me through
And now you're talkin' 'bout me too
And I know that I could never get away from you
Yeah, I'll wait for you to turn around and talk it through
But we won't
When we talk about, everything that happened
Rather sit around, don't need another lesson
You'd just call me out, call me when I'm distant
Always run your mouth, I don't wanna listen
All the shit you put me through, put me through
And now you're talkin' 'bout me too
And I know that I could never get away from you
Yeah, I'll wait for you to turn around and talk it through
But we won't"
5,Real Life,"Facetiming every night
I'll hide just to see your eyes
It's true I'll runaway with you
Can't stay forever this way
I'll break I won't be the same
It's true I wanna lay with you
Dancing inside of my mind
Feels like you're already mine
It's true I wanna sway with you
In real life
Ooo baby yeah in real life
Can't stand another white lie
And another goodbye
Last time I'm touching your face
We tried but I'm walking away
From you something I gotta do
In real life
Ooo baby yeah in real life
Can't stand another white lie
And another goodbye"
6,Blur,"The sun looks so pretty here
Inside the room that I'm spinning in
If I talk, it's like medicine
Then it turns into evidence
I guess I'd bet, if I see you again
I guess, I'd get excited
Don't care, don't care
I lied, I do
But I can't help
Need help to see you
I might, might make it wonderful for once
In my life but nothing's quite like it was
Surprised, something inside me is a blur
Hindsight, I should have lifted my eyes
The moon sits so pretty here
Set the mess that I guess I built
If I say I'm not eloquent
It's only 'cause I choose to forget
I guess I'd bet, if I see you again
I guess, I'd get excited
Don't care, I don't care
Yeah, I lied, yeah, I do
But I need help
I need help, I need help
I might, might make it wonderful for once
In my life but nothing's quite like it was
Surprised, something inside me is a blur
Hindsight, I should have lifted my eyes
It's all one sided
When I'm excited
Suppose, I mean it
I can't unsee it
I need to see you
Inside of my room
Talking to cables
I should have lifted my
I won't be misused
It's all that you do
I won't be misused
It's all that you do
It's all one sided
When I'm excited"
7,Paranoia,"Ooh, it's Valentine's Day in the city
Riding in the backseat
Come lay with me
Heavy on my mind
Every time you cry
Don't know what to do
I sit and stare at you
If, in the morning, I am with you
And in the evening, I am there
And if it's you that's always waiting
Kissing the flowers in my hair
Why do you think I have another?
When you have always been the one
Your paranoia is annoying
Now all I wanna do is run away
Here I am, but you never seem to notice
Let's take a walk, I wanna talk again
Heavy on my mind
Every time you cry
Tell me what to do
Can't get through to you
If, in the morning, I am with you
And in the evening, I am there
And if it's you that's always waiting
Kissing the flowers in my hair
Why do you think I have another?
When you have always been the one
Your paranoia is annoying
Now all I wanna do is run
Away"
8,Lejos de Ti,"El frío, la noche
Siempre me acuerdo de ti
Miles de canciones
Siempre me acuerdo de ti
¿Por qué estoy lejos de ti?
No te olvides de mi
¿Por qué estoy lejos de ti?
No te olvides de mi
Tus ojos tan tristes
Siempre me acuerdo de ti
Momentos felices
Siempre me acuerdo de ti
¿Por qué estoy lejos de ti?
No te olvides de mi
¿Por qué estoy lejos de ti?
No te olvides de mi
¿Por qué te sigo queriendo?
Ya no puedo más
Entre tus manos me estoy muriendo
¿Por qué yo sigo cantando
""No me queda más""
Entre mis labios a todo llanto?
Dormía en tu pecho
Siempre me acuerdo de ti
¿Por qué estás lejos de mi?
Yo no me olvido de ti
¿Por qué estás lejos de mi?
Nunca me olvido de ti"
9,Love You Anyway,"Wake up (wake up)
Just to see your face (just to see your face)
Stay up (stay up)
With you every day (with you every day)
Got to (got to, got to)
Find a better way (find a better way)
To tell you (tell you, tell you)
Before I run away (before I run away, ah-ah)
Maybe I may never find the words to say
Wait another lifetime so that I could stay
I know that you've always been in love with me
But I know that you've also had to watch me leave
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
I said it
I'm in love with you (I'm in love with you)
But I can't (I can't)
Tell you what to do (tell you what to do)
Oh my god (what a waste of breath)
Wanna live with me (and replace the rest)
So I won't ever break down
Maybe I may never find the words to say
Wait another lifetime so that I could stay
I know that you've always been in love with me
But I know that you've also had to watch me leave
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh
Ooh, I'll love you anyway
Ooh"
10,Ay No Puedo,"Ay, amor (ay, amor)
Te fuiste sin decir adiós
Por favor (por favor)
Vuelve con mi corazón
Tu boca está pintada en las estrellas
Un color hermoso cantando ""Doncella""
Así es, amor (así es, amor)
Es tan bonito y hecho pedazos
Ay, amor
No quiero verte al frente de otra en Ibiza, por favor
Bailando pasos en sus brazos, qué dolor
¿Qué pasa si más nunca me dejas en paz?
Llevo mil años amándote ya
No me puedo controlar
Yo te tengo que borrar
Fue tan bonito y hecho pedazos
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Llámame, llámame, llámame ya
Pero el amor te tiene que decir: ""ay, no puedo"""
11,No One Noticed,"Maybe I
Lost my mind
No one noticed
No one noticed
It's getting old (I'd kinda like it if you'd call me)
All alone ('cause I'm so over bein' lonely)
May have lost it (I need a virtual connection)
I have lost it (be my video obsession)
No one tried
To read my eyes
No one but you
Wish it weren't true
Maybe I (I'd kinda like it if you'd call me)
It's not right ('cause I'm so over being lonely)
Make you mine (I need a virtual connection)
Take our time (be my video obsession)
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me and then I'll leave without a trace
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me, then I'll leave without a trace
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane
Fly to your city excited to see your face
Hold me, console me and then I'll leave without a trace (maybe I)
Come on, don't leave me it can't be that easy, babe (it's not right)
If you believe me I guess I'll get on a plane (make you mine)
Fly to your city excited to see your face (take our time)
Hold me, console me and then I'll leave without a trace"
12,Vicious Sensitive Robot,"If I need to be true
Send my love and I'll send you
Never knock on your door
What do you think you need me for?
tell a lie
(Do-do-do) you're uptight
Nothing better to do
At least it's something I'm used to
How about you?
I got myself so high, I can't look down
Do it all to make your day, anything to take the pain away-ay
And if you don't see why I gotta go
Maybe I should get away, I would love to get away-ay-ay-ay
Call me back, but I don't
See myself in your cellphone
Never stay on the line
Hanging me up all the time
tell a lie
(Do-do-do-do) you're uptight
Nothing better to do
At least it's something I'm used to
How 'bout you? Ooh (ah-ah)
I got myself so high, I can't look down
Do it all to make your day, anything to take the pain away-ay
And if you don't see why I gotta go
Maybe I should get away, I would love to get away-ay-ay-ay (call me)
Call me back, but I don't
See myself in your cellphone
In your cellphone
Do-do-do, do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do
(Tell a lie) do-do-do
(You're uptight) do-do-do
(So uptight) do-do-do"
13,If Only,"Even when I dream
You are next to me
I can't fall asleep
If only
I can't say goodbye
Even when I try
Why'd I even leave?
You tell me
Don't give up on me
You'll eventually
Then I'll only see
You in my dreams"
14,Sienna,"Please tell me not to go
We've been here long before
I live under your eyelids
I'll always be yours
I'll lay on your rooftop in the freezing cold
And I'll watch the sunset wearing all your clothes
I can feel you with me like I did before
Like when I sang you a love song by Norah Jones
Ooh, Sienna
Would've been cute
Ooh, Sienna
Would look just like you
I came clean
And it feels so good
If I feel seen, mm
Only through you
I'll wait here tomorrow, outside your door
Like I did in December, when you held me close
Coming up on your corner, pulling out my hair
Hear the creak in the floorboards going up the stairs
Ooh, Sienna
Would've been cute
Ooh, Sienna
Would look just like you
With a temper like you, run around like you
Jumping in the pool, like you
Sing to all her pets in the way I did
Be sensitive like you
And I smile when I think of all the times we had
On the beach in the winter when the waves were mad
Down by the water, crystal clear
See her face in the forest then it disappears"
